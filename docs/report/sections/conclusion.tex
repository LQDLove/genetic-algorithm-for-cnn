\section{Conclusion}
We attempted to build a face detector for Right Whales, we applied different deep learning techniques such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Stacked Auto-Encoders and using a Genetic Algorithm to tune the CNN, but only CNN showed some promise in being able to classify different right whales with out best result at 25\% accuracy with the dataset $D_{3}$. The major problem we faced was pre-processing the images, we iterated through 4 different versions none of which enabled us to achieve a high classification accuracy. Had we been more experienced in image processing, we could have prepared the dataset better, giving us more time to focus on training neural networks.
